How to create a simple [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) web map that automatically pulls data from Google Sheets tables. Sidebar created using [leaflet-sidebar-v2](https://github.com/nickpeihl/leaflet-sidebar-v2), and Google Sheets connection with [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop). Tutorial for this process at https://rdrn.me/leaflet-maps-google-sheets/.
